### Hermes and Apollo

- [Paper PDF](./Paper 3.pdf)


This paper, both in content and in the message within the content, is an example of work that fuels me through passion. Writing this paper was exciting, effortless, and arguably some of my best work, and all of this comes from the genuine interest I had in the topic. Similarly, the content describes the artistic process as one either fueled by countless hours of effort or by passion, with a clear favor for the latter.

The capstone project has been a bit of both for me, certainly I could not have accomplished it if not for the countless hours of learning code before today, but it is most similar to the free artistic expression fueled by passion. At many points throughout the semester, I found myself drawn into a problem, looking for a clever solution. Whether it was populating a dropdown from the selected elements of another dropdown, input validation, or any of my other project, the work I did this semester was full of creative solutions motivated by a passion for the work I was doing.
