Start with Basics deck. Then when you are comfortable with that, move onto the Endgames deck and one or two openings.

For the Endgames, you only need to memorize the next move and whether it is a win or a draw. Once you actually find one of these endgames in a real game, come back and learn how to win it.

For openings, you are given an opponent's move and you need to remember what your next move is. These lines account for the best moves that your opponent can make and should help you handle any situation in the opening phase. Generally, but not always, if someone plays a move that is not in these opening lines that move is a mistake and you know, for sure, that you have an advantage. Try to figure out why their move is a mistake.

For the Sicilian lines, there are different options that you can choose as black between moves 4 and 6 ish. My personal recommendation is the Najdorf -> Main line.


For all lines, you can play these openings as white or as black, so if you find an opponent that plays one of these openings, you will know all the right moves to make. For this reason, even if you have openings you like, try to learn all of them.

In order of complexity, the openings included are:
- London (white)
- Dutch (Black (White plays d4))
- Caro Kann (Black (White plays e4))
- Vienna (White)
- Blackmar-Diemer (White)
- Sicilian (Black)
